Business Problem
The retailer wants to understand what kind of customers respond to different campaigns. To 
arrive at a reasonable answer to the above question, you've been tasked to analyze this 
dataset. Below are some pointed business questions you are required to answer.
Data Quality and Check --
1. Create a consolidated view of data by joining the data present in three files.
2. Are there any variables where you will need to clean the raw data, what kind of cleaning will be needed?
3. Create a data quality report after doing the necessary cleaning and joining of the files 
by:
• Doing univariates for continuous variables (compute: percentage of missing values, percentage of terms which are zero, mean, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th and 95th percentile, min and max)
• Doing univariates for categorical variables (compute:percentage of missing values, number of unique values)
4. Are there any extreme values of variables representing income, amount of money spent on various categories, recency of purchase?
5. Business Analysis and Hypothesis ---
6. Generate and check hypothesis around Amount Spent on different categories and response rate in different marketing campaigns.
7. Create a funnel analysis showing what percentage of unique customers accept campaign 1,2, 3,..etc
8. Find out how income impacts the amount spent on - Wine - Meat Products - Gold Products - Fish Products
9. Can you test the hypothesis that recent customers complain less in general compared to older customers?
10. Do people who accept the offer in the first campaign also accept in any other campaign?
11. Profile of people who respond vs. who don’t
